## Bubble Sort

### Concept:

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

### History:

Despite its simplicity and inefficiency for large datasets, Bubble Sort has been widely taught due to its straightforward implementation and educational value in introducing sorting algorithms.

### Pratical Applications:

- **Educational purposes:** Teaching the basics of sorting algorithms.
- **Small datasets:** Suitable for sorting small or nearly sorted datasets.
- **Detecting small errors:** Useful in scenarios where only a few elements are out of place.
