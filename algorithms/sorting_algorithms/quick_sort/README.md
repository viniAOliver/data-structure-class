## Quick Sort

### Concept:

Quick Sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

### History:

Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959, Quick Sort has become one of the most widely used sorting algorithms due to its average-case efficiency and in-place sorting capabilities.

### Pratical Applications:

- **Large datasets:** Efficiently sorting large amounts of data.
- **System libraries:** Commonly used in standard libraries for sorting functions.
- **Databases:** Organizing records for quick retrieval.
