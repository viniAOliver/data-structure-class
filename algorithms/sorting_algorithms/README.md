## Sorting Algorithms

### Concept:

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order — typically ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is critical to optimizing the performance of other algorithms (like search and merge operations) that require sorted data.

### History:

Sorting is one of the most studied problems in computer science. Early sorting methods such as Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort were simple to implement but inefficient for large data sets. More advanced techniques like Merge Sort (John von Neumann, 1945) and Quick Sort (Tony Hoare, 1959) significantly improved performance and remain relevant today.

### Pratical Applications:

- **Databases and search engines:** Efficient data retrieval.
- **E-commerce and analytics:** Sorting results by relevance or price.
- **Memory optimization:** Sorting enables better cache performance in systems.
