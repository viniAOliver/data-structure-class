## Non-Linear Data Structures

### Concept:

Unlike linear structures, non-linear data structures do not arrange data sequentially. Instead, elements are connected in a hierarchical or networked manner. This allows for more complex relationships between elements, like parent-child relationships in trees.

### History:

Non-linear structures became essential as computing evolved beyond simple linear processes. Binary trees, introduced in the mid-20th century, enabled efficient searching and hierarchical data storage. These structures are now crucial in databases, compilers, and artificial intelligence.

### Practical Applications:

- **Hierarchical data modeling:** Like file systems and organizational charts.
- **Efficient search and sort operations:** Binary search trees, heaps, and tries.
- **Artificial intelligence and decision-making:** Decision trees.

### Subfolders:

- [**binary_trees**](./binary_trees/): Trees where each node has up to two children, used in searching and sorting.
