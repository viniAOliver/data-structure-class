## Binary Trees

### Concept:

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### History:

Binary trees have been a cornerstone in computer science, with applications in various algorithms and data storage methods.

### Practical Applications:

- **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Facilitating fast lookup, addition, and removal of items.
- **Heaps:** Implementing priority queues.
- **Syntax trees:** Representing expressions in compilers.
- **Decision trees:** Used in machine learning for decision-making processes.
