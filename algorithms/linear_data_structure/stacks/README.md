## Stacks

### Concept:

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack, making it useful for scenarios where the most recent addition needs to be accessed first.

### History:

Stacks have been a fundamental concept in computer science, particularly in the management of function calls and expression evaluations.

### Practical Applications:

- **Function call management:** Keeping track of active subroutines in programming languages.
- **Undo/Redo functionality:** Reversing actions in applications like text editors.
- **Expression evaluation:** Converting and evaluating expressions in compilers.
- **Syntax parsing:** Analyzing code structure in compilers and interpreters.
