## Queues

### Concept:

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, ensuring that the order of processing matches the order of arrival.

### History:

The concept of queues has been fundamental in computer science, especially in the study of algorithms and operating systems, to manage processes and tasks efficiently.

### Practical Applications:

- **Task scheduling:** Managing processes in operating systems.
- **Print spooling:** Handling print jobs in the order they are received.
- **Breadth-first search (BFS):** A graph traversal algorithm that uses queues to explore nodes level by level.
- **Customer service systems:** Managing service requests in the order they arrive.
