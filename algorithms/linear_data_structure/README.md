## Linear Data Structures

### Concept:

Linear data structures organize data elements in a sequential manner, where elements are stored one after the other. Each element has a unique predecessor and successor, except for the first and last elements. These structures are foundational in programming and algorithm design.

### History:

Linear structures such as arrays and linked lists were among the first data structures developed during the early days of computing, as they closely mirrored the way memory is laid out in a machine. They are essential to understanding more complex structures and algorithms.

### Practical Applications:

- **Data management:** Storing and processing sequences of data.
- **Memory allocation:** Managing contiguous or dynamic memory blocks.
- **Task handling:** Queues and stacks help in scheduling and undo/redo systems.

### Subfolders:

- [**linked_lists**](./linked_lists/): Structures where each element points to the next.
- [**queues**](./queues/): FIFO (First In, First Out) structures used in task management.
- [**stacks**](./stacks/): LIFO (Last In, First Out) structures used in recursion and parsing.
