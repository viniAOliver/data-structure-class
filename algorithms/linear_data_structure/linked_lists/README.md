## Linked Lists

### Concept:

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

### History:

Linked lists were introduced by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon in 1955 as part of the development of the Information Processing Language (IPL), which was used in artificial intelligence research.

### Practical Applications:

- **Dynamic memory allocation:** Useful in scenarios where the size of the data structure is unknown at compile time.
- **Implementing stacks and queues:** Due to their dynamic nature, linked lists are ideal for these structures.
- **Graph representations:** Adjacency lists in graph algorithms often use linked lists.
- **Undo functionality in applications:** Each state can be stored as a node in a linked list.
